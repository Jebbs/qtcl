qtcl
====

qtcl (qt C Link) - a c wrapper around some qt classes for usage in D

I plan on using qt in an upcoming project, but qtd doesn't support the newest version of qt.

Right now I don't plan on wrapping everything, just what I plan on using, but if people become interested I might wrap more.
