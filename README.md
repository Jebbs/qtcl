qtcl (qt C Link) - a c wrapper around some qt classes for usage in D

I plan on using qt in an upcoming project, but qtd doesn't support qt 4.8 or greater. At the very least, I'd like to have it build on the same version for everything. I'll try to have it use qt 5 something if I can.

Right now I don't plan on wrapping everything, just what I plan on using, but if people become interested I might wrap more.

List of things to make usable in D:

* Windows
* Buttons
* Check Boxes
* Labels
* Progress Bar
* Layout Systems
* Text Editor
